ok, so.
When I run nops with sides, the output signals change within 1 sample of each other.
When I pull and wait, they're up to like 7 samples away???
When I just wait, they're back down to 1 sample difference.
  Could be in a rhythm.

30ns at 200MHz
54ns at 100MHz
190ns at 25MHz

So it takes like...5 clock cycles, for a wait to propagate?
Ah.  `mov pins, pins` takes 4-5 cycles.
So.  It seems that i/o round trip time is... 4.5 cycles; like, draw a line 4.5 cycles ago.  If a change happened before that, we know about it, if after, we don't.
  Plus or minus the uncertainty principle of in vs out times.
  I switched from clk pin 27 (an adc) to 21, and it seems to be faster by a cycle - still ~3.5, though
That kinda throws a wrench in the works.
...With INPUT_SYNC_BYPASS turned off, the latency is down to "anything more than 1 cycle ago, we know about it"
  However, "Sampling a metastable input can lead to unpredictable state machine behaviour. This should be avoided."
    So...not really a good idea.
I played with trying to game the delay to line up right, but I think I'm just going to sacrifice a bit as an artificial clock signal, and hold down tx.

Options I didn't fully explore:
  use CLKOUT as external clock for Pico
    maybe problem: 60MHz > 50MHz max
  *maybe* you can use the external gpio irq to the pios
